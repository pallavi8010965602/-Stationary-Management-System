# 📘 Stationary Management System (C Project)

This is a console-based mini-project developed in **C language** for managing inventory in a **stationery shop**. It is designed to replace the manual system used in college stationery stores and allows efficient stock management using simple file handling techniques.
## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a basic inventory management system that helps store owners or department staff to:
- Add new items to stock
- Sell items and update stock
- View current stock with total pricing
- Search items by their starting letter
  
## 🧠 Key Features
✅ **Add Stock**  
Add new items (name, quantity, price) and save them in a department-specific text file.

✅ **Sell Item**  
Update the stock when an item is sold and calculate the total price of the sold quantity.

✅ **View Stock**  
Display a list of all available items in a department with total prices (quantity × price).

✅ **Search Item**  
Search for items starting with a specific alphabet character.

✅ **Exit Program**  
Cleanly exits the system with a thank-you message.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Concepts**: File Handling, Structures, Loops, Functions, Conditional Logic
- **Environment**: Command Line (Console)
- **Storage**: Department-wise `.txt` files for inventory data
  
## 📂 File Structure & Storage
- Items are stored as:
- A separate `.txt` file is created for each department (e.g., `CS.txt`, `Mechanical.txt`, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in any C-compatible IDE (e.g., Turbo C, Code::Blocks, VS Code with GCC).
2. Compile the code.
3. Run the executable.
4. Use the menu to perform operations like Add, Sell, View, or Search stock.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Practice with **structures** and **file operations** in C.
- Develop a **modular menu-driven** program.
- Understand how to implement **real-world applications** using basic C concepts.
- Improve logic-building and program-structuring skills.
